# Part 1: Overview of the Dataset 
## Question 1: household and variable count
This dataset has 9066 households and 38 variables, including the household ID.

```
## [1] "rows: 9066"
```

```
##  [1] "ID"               "AGE_HEAD"         "AGE_SPOUSE"       "SEX_HEAD"        
##  [5] "SEX_SPOUSE"       "EDU_HEAD"         "EDU_SPOUSE"       "OCC_HEAD"        
##  [9] "OCC_SPOUSE"       "STATE"            "MARITAL"          "HOUSEHOLD_SIZE"  
## [13] "CHILDREN"         "SPOUSE_PRESENT"   "WEIGHT"           "INCOME"          
## [17] "HEAD_LABOR"       "SPOUSE_LABOR"     "WEEKS_HEAD"       "WEEKS_SPOUSE"    
## [21] "WEEKS_OUT_HEAD"   "WEEKS_OUT_SPOUSE" "EXP"              "GAS"             
## [25] "FOOD_HOME"        "FOOD_DELIV"       "FOOD_OUT"         "RENT"            
## [29] "EDUC_EXP"         "CHILDCARE"        "TRIPS"            "WEALTH"          
## [33] "HOUSE_VALUE"      "MORTGAGE"         "MORT_PAY"         "HOME_EQUITY"     
## [37] "BUSINESS_VAL"     "PROPERTY_TAX"
```

## Question 2  
The average age of the household head is 46.25. The highest age is 102 and the lowest age is 18.

```
## [1] "Mean age: 46.25"
```

```
## [1] "Highest age: 102"
```

```
## [1] "Lowest age: 18"
```

## Question 3: Income
The average household income is $78,265.69. This is substantially lower the $142k reported by the SCF in 2022 (Section 1.2, slide 9). One possible reason for this difference is that the SCF surveys a small sample, focusing on high-income individuals, resulting in a less representative mean. The PSID has a larger sample, with less emphasis on the top of the income distribution.

```
## [1] "Mean household income: 78265.69"
```

## Question 4: income range  
The household incomes in the dataset have a wide range: the lowest is -$267,900 and the highest is $2,125,100. The households with negative income are likely in debt.

```
## [1] "Lowest household income: -267900"
```

```
## [1] "Highest household income: 2125100"
```

## Question 5: spouse age  
Of the 4,523 households with a spouse of the household head present, the average age of the spouse is 45.64 years.

```
## [1] "Mean spouse age: 45.64"
```

## Question 6: household members
Households with only 1 member make up 28.45% of the data. Households with 5 or more members make up 11.29%. Compared to the histogram shown in class, the PSID has fewer 2-member households and more 3-5 member households. In both datasets, about 28% of households have one member. The PSID dataset has a smaller share of two-member households: only 30.43% compared to the nearly 35% shown on slide 2 [what dataset is this?]. PSID has a slightly larger share of households with 3 members: 15.95%, compared to the slide's 15%; a 13.88% share of 4-member households, compared to the slide's 12.5%; and a 7.2% share of 5-member households, compared to just past 5% in the slide.

# Part 2: Income Distribution   
## Question 1
The following histogram shows the distribution of household incomes in the PSID, with values above the 99th percentile removed. The distribution is right-skewed, as the median of $55,090 is lower than the mean of $78,266. The majority of households earn less than $100,682, which is the 75th percentile. A small minority of households surveyed have higher household incomes, up to $2.13 million.
